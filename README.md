What you need?
==============
A server for hosting APK file of android app and a simple script .

How does it works?
==================
1. This library comes with a service which communicates with server 
   And get the Latest version code and the link at which the APK file is hosted.

2. Once the server_version_code is obtained the service matches it with locat_version_code.
   And if server_version_coder is higher then broadcast is sent to the activity that a new version
   Is available. 

3. On receiving the broadcast the reveiver alerts the user by alert dialog asking if
   He/She wants to update the app. 

4. If user gives positive response then the service starts downloading
   The apk file from the link obtained in step 1.

5. Once the file download is complete the service sends the broadcast.
   The receiver of broadcast notifies user that new version is downloaded
   And if he/she would like to install new version

6. On positive response the app is installed on the android device


Script Code
============

The backend script must print 
-------------------------------------
1. Version code.
2. Link to the APK fie


The sample script receives two parameters
------------------------------------------
1. version : the value of this parameter gives the version code of apk presently installed on android device
2. val_key : This is the security key which will allow to show the latest version and APK link only on receiving   authorized request.

Output
-------
The script will match the value of val_key obtained from request and the value val_key stored at server and if there is match then the script will show Version code and link to APK file.

both the values must be seperated by SINGLE `</br>` tag.

See the sample script in Php.
